# Tearsheet

This is a simple Swift / DuckDB based library for analyzing and visualizing portfolio performance by calculating:
- cash weighted portfolio return using modified Dietz formula and compares it with benchmark
- drawdown 
- grouped returns
- sharpe, sortino, componded annual growth rate (cagr)
- distribution of daily returns 

At this moment it's quick hack stage, seems to work with xcode 16 / Sequoia 15  but needs further development.
